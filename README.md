# MyLibrary
I have a large number of books sitting on my shelves at home, I actually counted them and currently I have just over 200 of them. I love reading and my goal is to have a study in my house filled with books. Having so many books it's hard to remmeber which ones I've read, did I enjoy it, if I didnt, if I leant any books to friends, etc so I created this app as a solution to that problem. MyLibrary is a digital library that allows book enthusiast to keep track of all of the books in their home libraries, leave reviews and track books that are borrowed by friends. Users must simply create an account and get to work on digitizing their books!

User Stories:

-Users should be able to access all of their books once they log in.

-They should be able to click on a specific book to pull up their show page.

-In the show page they should be able to edit the information on the page.

-In the show page they should also be able to delete a book from their library.

-Users should be able to add a new book to their collection from the index page.

-Users should be able to navigate back to the index page from any page their on.
